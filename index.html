	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p><u>I'm Delilah</u> I am a CIS major at the 
		University of North Alabama (UNA). I am originally from 
		Los Angeles, CA. I met my husband in Dana Point,CA and we were married
		in 2012. We then moved from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" target="_blank"><strong><em>Los Angeles California</em></strong></a> to 
	    <a href="https://www.sandiego.org/" target="_blank"><strong><em>San Diego</a></em></strong> for two years while
		he was still in the <a href="https://www.marines.mil/" target="_blank"><strong><em>United States Marine Corps.</em></strong></a> After he got out of the 
		service we moved to Alabama in 2014 so that I would be able to attend college.</p><br>
		
		<p>I really love to travel. I was able to travel and live in Australia for a year and I have been there twice. 
		We ahve also visited New Zealand and Iceland recently. My husband and I plan on doing more travelling before going 
		back to California to settle down. I also really enjoy cooking, baking, and make from scratch candies like peanut brittle and
		almond roca.</p>
